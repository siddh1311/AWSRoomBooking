# AWS Room Booking Service

https://dev.d1vsdcfra5yqf8.amplifyapp.com/

The AWS Room Booking Project, sponsored by Amazon Web Services (AWS), tackles a major issue of the return to in-person work, finding free physical spaces of the right size for employee meetings. Our task is to create a meeting room booking system for AWS to reduce the stress of booking meeting rooms at AWS and enhance the work life of their employees.

## Login
The first step of accessing our project is logging in. Your administrator must add you as a user in the Manage Users page and once that has been done, you will receive a temporary password to login. From there, you can create your own permanent password and access the site. 

Password can be reset from the login page by clicking ‚ÄúForgot Password?‚Äù.

Once logged in, you can log out by clicking in the top-right corner of the screen and pressing ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù.

## Booking a Meeting

Booking a meeting is composed of three steps.
1. Select participants, date, room facilities, and number of rooms (groups)
  - Participants automatically include you
  - Room facilities will be automatically enabled for meetings in multiple rooms
  - Number of rooms must be at least the number of unique cities of the participants
2. Select timeslot (start time) and duration of your meeting
  - Timeslots are from 8:00 am - 7:00 pm
3. Select a room for each group and enter your meeting title
  - For multiple rooms, participants will be split into groups that optimally minimize the average travel distance for each participant.
  - Expand the table for each group to see its recommended rooms
  - Toggling ‚ÄúShow all rooms‚Äù will show rooms that are non-optimal, unavailable, or deactivated
